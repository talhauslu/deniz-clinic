                    <p>I chose dentistry because I wanted to follow in my parents’ footsteps. Growing up in their
                        office, I came to see how dentistry blends art and science in such a beautiful way, and how it
                        can make a huge impact on people’s health and wellbeing. I wanted to carry on their legacy and
                        impact my community in a positive and meaningful way.</p>
